/*

Build a program that prints all points in a 2D graph
A graph is a structure with many points. It also has a name.
A point is a structure with 2 numbers.
Both structures should have empty constructors and "full" constructos
Example:
Point pointA = Point();
Point pointB = Point(1.4f,2.6f);

Graph a = Graph();
Graph b = Graph("Gr√°fico A", { Any number of points })

Use the last program you made and:

Add a method to convert a graph and a point 
into a string and use it to print it
