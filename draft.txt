First of all and this will be very important:
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

After every instruction you need to add a ";" 
So instead of 
ola = 1
adeus = 2
ola + adeus 

You would write
ola = 1;
adeus = 2;
ola + adeus;

This will probably cause a lot of issues, so everytime there's a problem please confirm the ";"


Explain the concept of bytes 
I'm going to explain this very quickly, i just want you to get the general idea
So basically our computer's memory is separated in bytes, and every variable that we create occupies a number
Of bytes

int is 4 bytes
long is 8 bytes 

in Python you just say a number and it converts it to one of these types

A decimal number is a float. 
Instead of 2.1 you say 2.1f

Double is a "long" float, you also use 2.1f to represent this

In terms of text there will be 2 ways to represent them

Either through a type called character
Which represents a single character

char c = 'a';
Or a string
string c = "ola";

'' is the quote used for a character and "" is the quote used for a string

char c = "o"; DOES NOT WORK!

It's important to note that a string is a combination of characters



Multi dimensional types:

Array [ ] 
List new List
